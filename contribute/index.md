The [primary contributors](https://github.com/project-geode/docs/wiki/Apache-Incubator-Proposal#Initial_Committers) include long standing members of the GemFire engineering team, implementers and customers with long standing relationships.

The Apache Incubator Proposal for Geode can be found [here](https://github.com/project-geode/docs/wiki/Apache-Incubator-Proposal)
