# Contribute

Development of the code base for Geode began in 2002 as the commercial product GemFire. The open source version of Geode was released in April, 2015. 

The [primary contributors](https://github.com/project-geode/docs/wiki/Apache-Incubator-Proposal#Initial_Committers) include long standing members of the GemFire engineering team, implementers and customers with long standing relationships.

The Apache Incubator Proposal for Geode can be found [here](https://github.com/project-geode/docs/wiki/Apache-Incubator-Proposal)

Ideas for extending Geode code can be found in the wiki [here](https://github.com/project-geode/docs/wiki/How-to-Contribute).

There are many ways to support an open source software project beyond contributing code to the master branch. For Project Geode, here are some ways you can contribute today:

* **Post Issues:** Try out the Pivotal GemFire evaluation version, and post issues on the Project Geode GitHub site.

* **Documentation:** Add to the documentation, and submit new articles to the wiki for best practices and user training.

* **Website:** Improve the projectgeode.org website itself. For now it runs out of the project GitHub, but will hopefully to migrate to ASF infrastructure should they accept the proposal to incubate Project Geode.

* **Art & Design:** Offer to help with art & design of Project Geode. Pivotal has donated an initial look and feel, but the logos, branding, and identity are property of the Project.

* **Discuss:** Start and weigh in on discussions. Currently we are hosting threaded discussions both on the Pivotal GemFire forum, and the Project Geode Google group. Itâ€™s also common to find Stack Overflow questions covering GemFire and Geode. 

* **Present:** Give a presentation or create a video about the project.  We are already beginning to add presentations and training materials as they are created.  Feel free to download and use.  If you are hosting an event, put it into the community calendar on the site. If you create a new presentation, please check it into the project GitHub.
