# Contribute

Development of the code base for Geode began in 2002 as the commercial product GemFire. The open source version of Geode was released in April, 2015. 

The [primary contributors](https://github.com/project-geode/docs/wiki/Apache-Incubator-Proposal#Initial_Committers) include long standing members of the GemFire engineering team, implementers and customers with long standing relationships.

The Apache Incubator Proposal for Geode can be found [here](https://github.com/project-geode/docs/wiki/Apache-Incubator-Proposal)

If you'd like to participate, or contribute to the libraries on top of it, learn how to contribute [here](https://github.com/project-geode/docs/wiki/How-to-Contribute).
