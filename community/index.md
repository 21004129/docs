# Community

Project Haptic is used in a wide range of use cases for high performance computing and transactions. You can find example use cases on the Examples page. There are many ways to reach the community

##Mailing Lists and Forums
For help using Haptic: user@x.pivotal.io
For help related to contributing: dev@x.pivotal.io

StackOverflow tag [gemfire](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/gemfire) is an unofficial but active forum for usage questions and answers.

Pivotal also hosts a [GemFire Forum](https://support.pivotal.io/hc/communities/public/topics/200053218-Pivotal-GemFire-Forum) that will have answers to many usage questions as well.

###Issue Tracking
We use JIRA for issue tracking. (TBD) - need a link here
You can also subscribe to the mailing list issues@x.pivotal.io to receive emails about new issues and commits@x.pivotal.io for emails about commits.

###Conferences
+ApacheCon April 2015 (need more details here, what others shall we list??)

###Project History
***needs work
GemFire was launched as a result of lessons learnt from its predecessor - an object oriented database and its performance challenges in a highly scaled environment. The problems primarily stemmed from the centralized design in traditional database (RDB and Object oriented) and a design that used main-memory to optimize disk IO not application access patterns. 

The initial version of the product was a distributed caching product that allowed both C++ and Java applications to share objects in a scale out environment at high speeds. The team focussed on capital markets where the hunger for low latency was dominant with drastic changes through decimalization and regulations. 

It was through their experiences on wall street and the DoD (signal intelligence) that the team expanded to integrating real-time pub-sub and replication over the wide area network. All of this emerged well before the world had even heard the term NoSQL. 

GemFire, Tangosol Coherence (now Oracle) and Gigaspaces were the primary players in the creation of the IMDG. A new class of product that went beyond the traditional relational database. (Catherine, here is a article on Infoq that brings out the key characteristics the way I see it - http://www.infoq.com/articles/in-memory-data-grids )

Over time IMDGs started to get adopted in every single market - scalable web sites, travel apps, ……. 

Then, GemFire was purchased by VMWare in 2010 and was incorporated into the vFabric platform …… etc, etc… say something about adding persistence, recovery, backup, etc. Things that make Gemfire suitable as a data store also.
