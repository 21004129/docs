# Download

A proposal has been submitted to The Apache Software Foundation to incubate Project Geode. Until accepted by ASF, source code and binaries are available via an evaluation-only EULA. After acceptance, we intend to release versions under an Apache V2 license.

The source for Project Geode can be downloaded here:
[Pivotal Network Project Geode Source](https://network.pivotal.io/products/project-geode)
