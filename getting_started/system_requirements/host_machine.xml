			<p>Each machine that will run <keyword keyref="product_name_long"/> must meet the
				following requirements: <ul id="ul_6B9456040C104BEEBA4B5566672BE4D3">
					<li>A supported Java SE installation. See <xref
							href="supported_configurations.xml#system_requirements"/>.</li>
					<li id="li_4D48592F10C14E8AAB65A473488C1654">Adequate per-user quota of file
						handles (ulimit for Solaris and Linux). </li>
					<li id="li_2304FA3B3E2C4164B94C04922FE2AE01">TCP/IP. </li>
					<li id="li_787413A4D8C34CE6822EEDE6050A9F7D">System clock set to the correct
						time and a time synchronization service such as Network Time Protocol (NTP).
						Correct time stamps allow you to do the following activities: <ul
							id="ul_jyn_ybf_uc">
							<li id="li_F40FD45F62ED4F7AA3A73713CF1B7AF8">Produce logs that are
								useful for troubleshooting. Synchronized time stamps ensure that log
								messages from different hosts can be merged to reproduce a
								chronological history of a distributed run. </li>
							<li id="li_4686F89BFF9E4A25805A50A47BD8E932">Aggregate product-level and
								application-level time statistics.Â  </li>
							<li id="li_6F0D6FFEDEB4425DA8D6EC89E1209E56">Accurately monitor your
									<keyword keyref="product_name"/> system with scripts and other
								tools that read the system statistics and log files. </li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li id="li_D3A8BDF2C64C4345828D6ACDAFA44A26"> Hostname and host files that are
						properly configured for the machine. Hostname and host file configuration
						can affect <codeph>gfsh</codeph> and Pulse functionality. On Linux and Unix
						hosts, see the system manpages for more information on setting hostname and
						hosts. </li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p>
				<note>For troubleshooting, you must run a time synchronization service on all hosts.
					Synchronized time stamps allow you to merge log messages from different hosts,
					for an accurate chronological history of a distributed run. </note>
