      <strow>
        <stentry>Application Cache Node </stentry>

        <stentry>If you plan to set up a peer-to-peer configuration, you will
        need to purchase an Application Cache Node for each peer.
        Additionally, unless you purchase the Unlimited Client Upgrade
        (specified below), you will need to purchase an Application Cache Node
        for each client in a client/server configuration. </stentry>
      </strow>

      <strow>
        <stentry>Data Management Node </stentry>

        <stentry>If you plan to set up a client/server configuration, a Data
        Management Node is required for each server. Unless you purchase an
        Unlimited Client Upgrade, you will need to purchase an Application
        Cache Node for each client in a client/server configuration.
        </stentry>
      </strow>

      <strow>
        <stentry>Global WAN Upgrade </stentry>

        <stentry>This upgrade is needed to connect Data Management Nodes
        together when you have multiple geographical regions. A Global WAN
        Upgrade must be applied to all Data Management Nodes in a data grid.
        </stentry>
      </strow>

      <strow>
        <stentry>Unlimited Client Upgrade </stentry>

        <stentry>This upgrade allows unlimited client connectivity to a Data
        Management Node. It is a cost effective way to meet the needs of
        high-client topologies.</stentry>
