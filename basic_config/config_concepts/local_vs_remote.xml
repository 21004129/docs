			<p>Discussions of <keyword keyref="product_name"/> membership and caching activities often differentiate between
				local and remote. Local caching always refers to the central member under
				discussion, if there is one such obvious member, and remote refers to other members.
				If there is no clear, single local member, the discussion assigns names to the
				members to differentiate. Operations, data, configuration, and so forth that are
				"local to member Q" are running or resident inside the member Q process. Operations,
				data, configuration, and so on, that are "remote to member Q" are running or
				resident inside some other member. </p>
			<p>The local cache is the cache belonging to the local member. All other caches are
				remote, whether in other members of the same distributed system or in different
				distributed systems. </p>
