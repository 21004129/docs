			<h2>Elastic performance</h2>
			<p>All data in is stored in-memory for low latency. Performance scales linearly as nodes are added. Data is distributed automatically between nodes to optimize performance.</p>
		</div>
		<div class='benefit'>
			<h2>Database consistency</h2>
			<p>Data is persisted in write-optimized disk storage. Consistency checking is configurable between highest performance caching and ACID transactions.</p>
		</div>
		<div class='benefit'>
			<h2>Resilient clustering</h2>
			<p>Clusters fail-over to other nodes in case of failures, and rebalance remaining resources. Clusters self-heal when nodes return to operation.</p>
