  <title>Behavior of <keyword keyref="product_name"/> Cache Writers and Loaders Under JTA</title>
  <shortdesc>When <keyword keyref="product_name"/> participates in a global transactions, you can
    still have <keyword keyref="product_name"/> cache writers and cache loaders operating in the
    usual way. </shortdesc>
  <conbody>
    <p>For example, in addition to the transactional connection to the database, the region could
      also have a cache writer and cache loader configured to exchange data with that same database.
      As long as the data source is transactional, which means that it can detect the transaction
      manager, the cache writer and cache loader participate in the transaction. If the JTA rolls
      back its transaction, the changes made by the cache loader and the cache writer are rolled
      back. For more on transactional data sources, see the discussion of XAPooledDataSource and
      ManagedDataSource in<xref
        href="configuring_db_connections_using_JNDI.xml#topic_A5E3A67C808D48C08E1F0DC167C5C494"/>. </p>
    <p>If you are using a <keyword keyref="product_name"/> cache or transaction listener with global
      transactions, be aware that the EntryEvent returned by a transaction has the <keyword
        keyref="product_name"/> transaction ID, not the JTA transaction ID.</p>
