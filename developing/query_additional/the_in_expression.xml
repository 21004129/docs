		<p>The IN expression is a boolean indicating if one expression is present
		  inside a collection of expressions of compatible type. The determination is
		  based on the expressions' equals semantics. 
		</p> 
		<p>If 
		  <codeph>e1</codeph> and 
		  <codeph>e2</codeph> are expressions, 
		  <codeph>e2</codeph> is a collection, and 
		  <codeph>e1</codeph> is an object or a literal whose type is a subtype
		  or the same type as the elements of 
		  <codeph>e2</codeph>, then 
		  <codeph>e1 IN e2</codeph> is an expression of type boolean. 
		</p> 
		<p>The expression returns: 
		<ul id="ul_2DB695F6FE364C9A93A162E84A9C0D8F"> 
		  <li id="li_AA00FED209F44DC78886151B044089E1">TRUE if e1 is not
			 UNDEFINED and is contained in collection e2 
		  </li> 
		  <li id="li_BB2DA7F60AA448C5BFCF28D33BAF5953">FALSE if e1 is not
			 UNDEFINED and is not contained in collection e2 # 
		  </li> 
		  <li id="li_D0901771813C4845999853656AEC6FC0">UNDEFINED if e1 is
			 UNDEFINED 
		  </li> 
		</ul> 
		</p> 
		<p>For example, 
		  <codeph>2 IN SET(1, 2, 3)</codeph> is TRUE. 
		</p> 
		<p>Another example is when the collection you are querying into is
		  defined by a subquery. This query looks for companies that have an active
		  portfolio on file: 
		  <codeblock>SELECT name, address FROM /company 
  WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM /portfolios WHERE status = 'active')</codeblock> 
		</p> 
		<p>The interior SELECT statement returns a collection of ids for all
		  /portfolios entries whose status is active. The exterior SELECT iterates over
		  /company, comparing each entry’s id with this collection. For each entry, if
		  the IN expression returns TRUE, the associated name and address are added to
		  the outer SELECT’s collection.
