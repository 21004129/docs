  <title>Targeting Members or Member Groups</title>

		<draft-comment>NOTES IN PROGRESS
		</draft-comment>Allow a peer to target a single peer member of a member
		group for a function execution.
	 </p>
	 <p> Allow a peer to target all peer members of a member group for a
		function execution.
	 </p>
	 <p> Allow a client to target a single peer member of a member group and who
		is also a peer of a server that the client is connected to for a function
		execution.
	 </p>
	 <p> Allow a client to target all peer members of a member group and who are
		also peers of a server that the client is connected to for a function
		execution.
	 </p>
	 <p>FunctionService new methods:
	 </p>
	 <p> onMember(DistributedSystem ds, String... memberGroups)
	 </p>
	 <p> onMembers(DistributedSystem ds, String... memberGroups)
	 </p>
	 <p> onServer(Pool p, String... memberGroups)
	 </p>
	 <p> onServers(Pool p, String... memberGroups)
	 </p>
	 <p> onServer(RegionService rs, String... memberGroups)
	 </p>
	 <p> onServers(RegionService rs, String... memberGroups)
	 </p>
	 <p> These methods are overloaded flavors of existing methods that just add
		a "memberGroups" parameter. The new semantics will be consistent with the old.
		The only difference is that the execution will be limited to members of the
		given groups.
