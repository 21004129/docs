  <title>Using PDX Serialization</title> 
  <shortdesc>To use PDX serialization, you can configure and use vFabric
	 GemFire's reflection-based autoserializer, or you can program the serialization
	 of your objects by using the PDX interfaces and classes. 
  </shortdesc> 
  <prolog audience="basic"/> 
  <conbody> 
	 <p>Optionally, program your application code to deserialize individual
		fields out of PDX representations of your serialized objects. You may also need
		to persist your PDX metadata to disk for recovery on startup.
