		Portable Data eXchange (PDX) is a cross-language data format that can reduce the cost of
		distributing and serializing your objects. PDX stores data in named fields that you can
		access individually, to avoid the cost of deserializing the entire data object. PDX also
		allows you to mix versions of objects where you have added or removed fields. </shortdesc>
