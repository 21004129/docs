	<title>Working with Indexes</title>
	<shortdesc> The <keyword keyref="product_name"/> query engine supports indexing. An index can
		provide significant performance gains for query execution.</shortdesc>

			<p>A query run without the aid of an index iterates through every object in the
				collection. If an index is available that matches part or all of the query
				specification, the query iterates only over the indexed set, and query processing
				time can be reduced. </p>
