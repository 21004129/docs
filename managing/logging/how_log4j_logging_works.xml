			<p>Documentation should recommend file rolling will be enabled
				“OnStartup” using OnStartupTriggeringPolicy. This means that at
				process startup, log file will roll to create a new one which
				will have the banner logged to it same as always. Additional
				trigger policy and rolling details as provided by Log4J 2 should
				be covered. Appenders section in default log4j2.xml is simple:
				<codeblock>&lt;Appenders&gt;
   &lt;Console name="STDOUT" target="SYSTEM_OUT"&gt;
	&lt;PatternLayout pattern="${gemfire-pattern}"/&gt;
   &lt;/Console&gt;
&lt;/Appenders&gt;</codeblock>
				PatternLayout requires a custom
				com.gemstone.gemfire.logging.internal.log4j.ThreadIdPatternConverter
				class that extends LogEventPatternConverter so that we can
				provide the ThreadId which is part of the log line of the old
				LogWriter format. The default GemFire PatternLayout looks like
				(TODO: add in Marker and LoggerName):
				<codeblock>&lt;Property name="gemfire-pattern"&gt;[%level{lowerCase=true} %date{yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss.SSS z}
        &amp;lt;%thread&amp;gt; tid=%tid] %message%n%throwable%n&lt;/Property&gt;</codeblock>The
				legacy GemFire PatternLayout is only used for LogWriterAppender
				when “log-” properties are configured and looks like:
				<codeblock>&lt;Property name="logwriter-gemfire-pattern">[%level{TRACE=finer, DEBUG=fine, INFO=info, WARN=warning, ERROR=error, FATAL=severe} %date{yyyy/MM/dd HH:mm:ss.SSS z} &amp;lt;%thread&amp;gt; tid=%tid] %message%n%throwable%n&lt;/Property></codeblock>The
				default Loggers section for GemFire loggers looks
				like:<codeblock>&lt;Logger name="com.gemstone.gemfire" level="INFO" additivity="false"&gt;
	&lt;AppenderRef ref="STDOUT"/&gt;
&lt;/Logger&gt;</codeblock>Example
				of adding a log4j2 RollingFileAppender to enable logging to a
				file with rolling support instead of relying on the
				LogWriterAppender that provides backwards compatibility:
				<codeblock>&lt;RollingFile name="ROLLINGFILE" fileName="server1.log"
	filePattern="server1-%i.log"&gt;
	&lt;PatternLayout&gt;
		&lt;pattern&gt;${gemfire-pattern}&lt;/pattern&gt;
	&lt;/PatternLayout&gt;
	&lt;Policies&gt;
		&lt;OnStartupTriggeringPolicy /&gt;
		&lt;SizeBasedTriggeringPolicy size="2 GB"/&gt;
	&lt;/Policies&gt;
	&lt;DefaultRolloverStrategy max="20"/&gt;
