	<title>Security</title>
	<shortdesc>The security framework establishes trust between members and authorizes cache
		operations from clients based on that trust. You establish trust by verifying credentials
		when one process connects to another. </shortdesc>
	<conbody>
		<p>For example: <ul id="ul_47D572C43C5E4D6D897F752679562B09">
				<li id="li_C4810CEAAC3C493E8E5FB19BCAF480B7">New members connect to the locator in a
					peer-to-peer topology. </li>
				<li id="li_E3A37CB9D5A149BEB5D45F2B8F00339E">Clients connect to cache servers. </li>
				<li id="li_26E1EF34086F4CB38418F3AE34C9D43F">A Diffie-Hellman key exchange encrypts
					sensitive credentials. </li>
